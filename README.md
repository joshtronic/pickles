Pickles f/k/a PICKLES (PHP Interface Collection of Killer Libraries to Enhance
Stuff) is an open source framework for the rapid development of RESTful
services. The intention of this framework is to allow developers to a means to
develop service-oriented backend systems that are completely decoupled from the
front end components. Thus allowing the freedom to build the front end
implementation(s) using whichever tools they choose, be it Ember.js, Angular.js
or some cool new system Iâ€™ve yet to hear of.
