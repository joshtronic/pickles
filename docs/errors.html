Warning: strftime(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'America/New_York' for 'EDT/-4.0/DST' instead in /usr/local/Cellar/php53/5.3.13/lib/php/PhpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/Smarty-2.6.0/libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php on line 370
